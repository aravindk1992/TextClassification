The distribution of categories in the corpus is highly skewed,\n",
    "with 36.7% of the documents in the most common category, and only 0.0185% (2 documents) in each of the five least common categories.

    "## Feature Extraction\n",
    "Key thing to realizing a machine learning system is feature extraction. Often times 80% of the time and effort in a Machine Learning project is spent on realizing technique that give us good features to work with. Even an effective algorithm becomes useless when we use bad feature selection. The most popular technique that is used in text classification is the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model'> <b>Bag of Words</b> </a> representation which converts the input text data into its numeric represenation. The Bag of Words model learns a vocabulary from all of the documents, then models each document by counting the number of times each word appears. *For example, consider the following two sentences:\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "Sentence 1: \"The cat sat on the hat\"\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "Sentence 2: \"The dog ate the cat and the hat\"\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "From these two sentences, our vocabulary is as follows:\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "{ the, cat, sat, on, hat, dog, ate, and }\n",
    "<br/>\"\n",
    "To get our bags of words, we count the number of times each word occurs in each sentence. In Sentence 1, \"the\" appears twice, and \"cat\", \"sat\", \"on\", and \"hat\" each appear once, so the feature vector for Sentence 1 is:\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "{ the, cat, sat, on, hat, dog, ate, and }\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "Sentence 1: { 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0 }\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "Similarly, the features for Sentence 2 are: { 3, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1}\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "*Example and explanation taken from <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/c/word2vec-nlp-tutorial/details/part-1-for-beginners-bag-of-words'>Kaggle</a> \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us fire up the <b><i> sklearn.feature_extraction.text</i></b> and start building the bag of words representation for the training data. \n",
    "<br/> While constructing the bag of words representation, we come across words such as \"the\", \"a\", \"am\".. which do not add any meaning. So these words are filtered out before processing the input text. This is primarily done to reduce the dimensionality of the data. We begin by importing the stopwords.txt file from the reuters corpus into a set and passing that as a argument to CountVectorizer."

    "LSI is an indexing and retrieval method that uses a mathematical technique called singular value decomposition (SVD) to identify patterns in the relationships between the terms and concepts contained in an unstructured collection of text. LSI is based on the principle that words that are used in the same contexts tend to have similar meanings. A key feature of LSI is its ability to extract the conceptual content of a body of text by establishing associations between those terms that occur in similar contexts. It is called Latent Semantic Indexing because of its ability to correlate semantically related terms that are latent in a collection of text. The method, also called latent semantic analysis (LSA), uncovers the underlying latent semantic structure in the usage of words in a body of text and how it can be used to extract the meaning of the text in response to user queries, commonly referred to as concept searches. Queries, or concept searches, against a set of documents that have undergone LSI will return results that are conceptually similar in meaning to the search criteria even if the results don’t share a specific word or words with the search criteria. *<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_semantic_indexing'>Source</a>\n",

    "For a test document that belongs to the <b>meal-feed</b> class, the LSI model predicts <b>corn</b>. Now on closer inspection we find that the predicted class makes a intuitive sense and in fact we are not completely wrong to classify it as meal-feed as corn is infact a  primary meal source in some countries such as China, Brazil and Mexico. Similarly <b>Bop(balance of payments)</b> is very close to <b>trade</b> and the same goes for <b>Crude</b> and <b>nat-gas (Natural Gas) </b>. Since these classes are semantically very close to each other, any misclassifications arising out of such a scenario would not be very expensive. Though the <b> Accuracy </b> numbers of a LSI model is <b>72%</b> but the predictions in LSI are very intuitive and can make a very good business sense when deployed in real time systems.   \n"

    "Well i hear you! There are some interesting models such as <b><i> Logistic Regression </i></b> and <b><i> Stochastic Gradient Descent </i></b> at your disposal. These methods are very popular in literature. However i wanted to stick with Naive Bayes as it is very simple and elegant. \n",
    "<br/> In my pursuit to try and make the NB model work, i explored some very interesting NLP concepts such as Stemmers and Lemmatizers, Collocations, , Document Summarizers (which i will try to cover in a seperate tutorial soon) and Stanford NER (Named Entity Recognizer). [NER](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition) helps identify what's \"important\" in a text document. Also called *entity extraction*, this process involves automatically extracting the names of persons, places, organizations, and potentially other entity types out of unstructured text. Building an NER classifier requires *lots* of annotated training data and some [fancy machine learning algorithms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_random_field). These helped establish a very cool news article summarizer that i am working on currently. The summarizer was made with an intention to summarize large chunk of texts in order to reduce the dimensionality of datasets for the classifer models.  I hope to add other capabilities and make a nefty text summarizer for me to summarize those boring lecture notes ;) \n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "I also experimented with the <b>gensim</b> package which helped me try out the LSI model on the input with promising results. Deep Learning techniques such as <a href='https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/'><b>Google's Word2Vec</b></a> are also interesting alternatives for the bow of word representation that you can use on the existing model.

    "## Beyond Naive Bayes- Logistic Regression and Stochastic Gradient Descent\n",
    "Logistic regression is one of my personal favorite algorithm when it comes to multi-class classification. This model is so simple and yet gives amazing result out of the box. The best starting point would be this <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression'> Wikipedia </a> entry. Fortunately for us we have the Logistic Regression implementation in scikit-learn which we will code up quickly in just a minute. You can check out this <a href='http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/sgd.html'>page</a> on scikit-learn that talks about using the Stochastic Gradient Descent as a classifier. So let's try both of them out!"

    "## What Next?\n",
    "Hopeful in the next set of tutorials i'll cover some Web scraping tutorials along with a few NLP concepts such as stemmers,lemmatizers and Named Entity Recognizer which will help us make better feature selection. We'll also work towards creating an Ensemble Classifier wherein we will combine all the 3 models viz Multinomial Naive Bayes, LogisticRegression and SGDClassifier to create a more accurate model for text classification. I would love to hear from you. Shoot me an email at aravindk@buffalo.edu for any suggestions, changes, comments and feedback. \n",
